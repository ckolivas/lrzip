minor.
* Further tighten up ram restrictions with stdin/stdout to prevent running out
of memory with all the buffers involved.
* Massive files fail with -U due to trying to allocate the whole lot in ram
while doing checksums. Do it piecemeal to avoid the problem. Patch and debugging

* Check for successful calloc of hash table only after performing it.
* stdin_eof is just a bool

MARCH 2012, version 0.611 Con Kolivas.
* Move the update counter to earlier in the hash_search so it still updates even
when there are not matches.
* Perform all checksumming in a separate thread to speed up the hash search in
the rzip phase.
* Optimise the hot function empty_hash.
* Micro-optimise the hot next_tag function.
* Micro-optimise the match_len function.
* Pass one less variable to the get_sb function as an optimisation.
* Cache the hash_entry value passing one less variable to hash_empty as a
micro-optimisation.
* Use ffsl for a faster lesser_bitness function.
* Prevent lrzuntar from automatically overwriting existing directories without
the -f option being specified.
* Calling lrzip via lrzcat would fail as the proper parameters weren't being
passed to the control structure. Fix.


MARCH 2012, version 0.610 Con Kolivas, Michael Blumenkrantz
* Implement complete set of liblrzip libraries, documentation and example uses
with support for simple lrzip_compress() and lrzip_decompress() or complete
fine-grained control over all compression and decompression options.
* Use as much of the low buffer as possible with a single memcopy before going
fine grained byte by byte.
* Preserve the compressed time on decompression where suitable.
* Store a copy of the control struct to be reused on subsequent files to prevent
variables being modified in the control struct on the first file that corrupt
compression/decompression of the 2nd file.
* Explicitly select C99 to avoid certain warnings.
* Generic modifications to silence -Wextra warnings.
* Fix typos.
* Use an array of parameters in lrztar to allow working with directories with
spaces in their names.


SEPTEMBER 2011, version 0.608 Con Kolivas
* get_sb only allows accessing one byte at a time, yet we don't need that
functionality when sliding mmap is not in use. Use different versions of the
function and the larger memcpys depending on whether sliding mmap is in use or
not. This affords a substantial speedup in the rzip phase of files not requiring
sliding mmap.
* A small optimisation of moving the check for remapping the low buffer also
speeds up the sliding mmap version slightly.
* Installation of the included bash completion script was disabled to avoid
conflict with distribution bash completion packages.
* Minor cleanup of sha4.h
* Make mremap use the fake mremap on all platforms not linux.

SEPTEMBER 2011, version 0.607 Con Kolivas
* Updated lzma library to version 920.
* Fixed a rare unable-to-decompress corner case.
* Added lrzip completion script.
* Updated makefile to more portable posix version.
* Hopefully fixed compilation on FreeBSD not supporting memopen.
* Added lots more debugging information about offsets in max verbose mode.
* Removed error and warning messages that are spammy or harmless.

MAY 2011, version 0.606 Con Kolivas
* lrzuntar broke as lrzip doesn't automatically use stdout now, so use lrzcat
in the lrztar script instead.

MAY 2011, version 0.605 Con Kolivas
* Addition of explicit lrzcat symlink which automatically sets "-d -o -"
* Revert automatic output to stdout due to addition of explicit lrzcat
executable, and to be consistent with gzip.
* Fix counter from being zeroed on every loop in rzip.c which was creating
excess progress output.
* Update GNU license.
* Set aside at least page_size of zeroes when compressing a chunk, thus
allowing files that are otherwise too small to compress with lrzip to be
compressed. The zeroes will just be dropped on decompression.
* Add explicit checks to cope with zero sized files as well.
* Remove the arbitrary 128 byte minimum size restriction on archives now that
any size file can be safely archived.
* Set the eof flag when reading older file format files to not hang on zero
byte sized archives.
* Update the percentage counter when getting file info to not overflow with
tiny files.
* Set the maximum file mode to 0666 to avoid setting the executable bit when
permissions are not carried over (such as from STDIO).

APRIL 2011, version 0.604 Con Kolivas
* Detach threads after creating them on the compression side. Not joining them
meant that compressing massive files requiring hundreds of threads would
eventually hit the resource limit of number of threads created even though
the threads themselves would exit.

APRIL 2011, version 0.603 Con Kolivas, George Makrydakis, Jari Aalto.
* lseek in stream.c wasn't being compiled to the lseek64 variant on Apple
due to missing includes, breaking >2GB files. Added includes.
* Detect when stdout is being redirected and automatically direct output to
stdout unless a filename is specified.
* Update lrztar to properly support -S -O and -o, and use new syntax not
requiring '-o -' for stdout.
* Update lrzip.conf to support encryption.
* Do a sanity check to ensure lrzip is not attempting to work on a directory.
* Typo fixes.

APRIL 2011, version 0.602 Con Kolivas
* Fixed the symlinks breaking package generation.
* Made maximum chunk allocable on 32bits 2/3 of a GB again limiting total ram
used to 2GB, regardless of how much crazy ram people have put on such systems
since the rest is unusable.
* Now builds on Cygwin courtesy of Тулебаев Салават.
* Check for podman on ./configure.
* Disable md5 generation and checking on Apple till it's fixed.
* Display full version when -V is invoked.
* Don't restrict file permissions from unknown source, respecting umode
instead.

MARCH 2011, version 0.601 Con Kolivas
* Fixed the symlinks for lrzuntar, lrunzip not being installed.
* Fixed the pod-based manpages not being installed.
* Clearly demonstrate that ASM is not supported on 64bits.

MARCH 2011, version 0.600 Con Kolivas
* Massive rewrite with new file format to accomodate new features.
* Allocate temporary buffers of safely sized ram that can act as temporary
storage for performing de/compression to/from STDIN/STDOUT without requiring
temporary physical files. Files compressed on machines with much larger ram
being decompressed on smaller ram machines may still require temporary files,
but as much as possible is done using in-ram decompression, and minimally
sized temporary files. Information displayed is more verbose and accurate in
STDIN/STDOUT mode.
* The temporary buffers created for decompressing to STDOUT are also used
for decompressing regular files now avoiding multiple write/reads when
re-constructing the file on decompression. This can dramatically speed up
the rzip phase of decompression on complicated files with many small matches,
and always makes testing faster.
* Compress block headers as well now since we know how many bytes can be used
to describe the length of the block, decreasing overall file size.
* Store the rzip chunk size per chunk to make it possible to check total file
size by summating each rzip chunk size when it's not known till the end (as
happens when compressing from STDIN).
* Implement password protected encryption. Import the polarssl code for
sha512 and aes128 routines. Read password without echoing to screen by
disabling echo via terminfo. Take the password then multiply hash it
according to the date it was generated. Inrease the number of hashes according
to Moore's law so it always takes approximately 1 second per password on the
most modern hardware when first encrypted. Hash the password against 8 bytes
of salt which is a combination of the 2 byte encoded loop counter (for how
many times to hash the password) and 6 random bytes. Take random from
/dev/urandom if it's available and fall back to random() if not. Encrypt each
block of compressed data with 8 extra bytes of random salt. Once the headers
are written, go back and encrypt the headers as well. Then encrypt the md5
hash value as well. Anything beyond the initial lrzip magic header should
apppear as random data and no two successive encryptions of the same data with
the same password should generate the same data.
* New build system should be more robust and portable.
* Abstract out functions better into separate files and headers, and remove
all use of global variables. This will make the generation of an lrzip
library possible in the future.
* Prevent testmalloc from coming up with a negative number when determining
how big a block of memory to allocate by decreasing the number of threads to
be used and then aborting to a minimum value should it still be too much
apparent ram.
* Big Endian fixes.
* Change lrztar and lrzuntar to not use temporary files.
* Countless other fixes, documentation and cleanups.

MARCH 2011, version 0.571 Con Kolivas
* Only retry mmaping if it's a memory error, otherwise it may give spurious
errors.
* Check for free space before compression/decompression and abort if there
is inadequate free space if the -f option is not passed.
* Fix the wrong check in rzip.c which was rounding down the page size and
making for one extra small chunk at the end.
* Check the correct stdout when refusing to pipe to a terminal.
* Fix windows EOL on lzma.txt.
* Ignore what stdout is going to when testing from stdin.
* More verbose summary after we know whether we have stdin/out to more
accurately reflect the window that will be used.
* Updated gitignore
* Unlink temporary files immediately to avoid files lying around.
* Check free space AFTER reading magic, and not when decompressing to stdout.
* Don't dump output to stdout when just testing a file.
* Dump the temporary file generated on emulating stdout on decompression after
every chunk is decompressed instead of after the whole file is decompressed.
* Don't attempt to file check decompression when it's not meaningful (test
only or to stdout).
* Clean up and simplify the times displayed component. It could potentially
show thousands of seconds.
* Remove open coded strerror messages when they're to be printed by fatal().

MARCH 2011, Michael Blumenkrantz
* Updated autotools/conf build system.

FEBRUARY 2011, version 0.570 Con Kolivas
* Change the lzo testing to a bool on/off instead of taking a parameter.
* Clean up the messy help output.
* Refuse to read from or write to terminal in stdin/stdout mode.
* Delete temporary files generated when testing from stdin.
* Don't call perror on failures that aren't system related.
* Improve visual output.
* Significant multi-threading speed-ups - as the spawning of threads is
partially serialised, use one more thread than CPUs.
* Don't split up the chunks into multiple threads when no back end
compression is being used.
* Take into account the precise amount of overhead that the memory hungry
back-end compression modes lzma and zpaq use when determining how much ram to
allocate, and limit total back-end compression ram to 1/3.
* Deprecate the -M option as it is no longer of any significant utility
compared to the -U option.
* Strip symbols by default in compilation and add -W -Wall to CXXFLAGS to be
consistent with CFLAGS.
* Update benchmarks.
* Add verbose and max verbose modes for -i information giving a breakdown of
each rzip chunk and compressed block.
* Modify purpose of -T threshold option to mean Disable LZO pre-compression
 testing. Threshold level test deprecated.
* Make failure to allocate a buffer in the compress_ functions put out an
error message always rather than just in max_verbose mode.

FEBRUARY 2011, Peter Hyman
* Minor updates to man pages, lrzip.conf example file.
* Update main help screen to include environment settings.
* Update to respect $TMP environment variable for TMP files.
* Updated control structure to include tmpdir pointer.
* Update lrzip.conf parser to respect -U, -H, -T, k, and -c options.
* Update lrzip.conf example to include new parameters.
* Reorder main Switch loop in main.c for readability.
* Have UNLIMITED and control.window be exclusive. UNLIMITED wins.
* Corrects heuristic computation in rzip.c which would override
  UNLIMITED if control.window set
* Show heuristically computed control.window when computed.
* Remove display compression level from control.window verbose output.
* Update print_verbose format for Testing for incompressible data in stream.c
  to omit extra \n.

FEBRUARY 2011, version 0.560 Con Kolivas
* Rewrote the locking implementation to use pthread_mutexes instead of
semaphores. This makes multi-threading work on OSX.
* Re-use a single malloc in unzip_match instead of multiple malloc/frees.
* Imported the md5 code from coreutils and modified them to be used by lrzip.
* Implemented md5 hash checking on compression and decompression by using
buffers to pass to the existing crc checking and re-using them for the md5
checking.
* Sped up the hash checking on compression by not reading the whole chunk at
once to do the hash check, and instead read one paged size chunk.
* Store the md5 hash value at the end of the archive, maintaining backward
compatibility with existing 0.5 versions of lrzip, and place a flag in the
header denoting its existence.
* Use the header flag for md5's existence to determine what hash check to
perform on decompression.
* Add hash value display to maximum verbose output and in information mode.
* Add -H option to enable hash value displaying without verbose mode.
* Display what hash checking will be used on decompression in verbose mode and
in information displayed with -i.
* Add -c option to perform a hash check on the file generated on decompression,
comparing it to that stored in the lrzip archive, or that generated on
decompression on archives that do not have it stored.
* Delete broken or damaged files generated on interruption or when they fail
integrity testing by default.
* Implement the -k option to keep broken or damaged files.

FEBRUARY 2011, version 0.552 Con Kolivas
* Fix incompressible blocks causing failure with bzip2 and gzip.
* Freebsd doesn't do mremap, use the fake one.
* Update copyright notices.
* Flush writes to disk before allocating ram.
* Relax memory allocation when no back end compression will be used.
* Clean up unnecessary semaphore usage in decompression.
* Fix minor typos.
* Convert mmaps to malloc in runzip as they may silently fail if not a
multiple of page size, thereby leading to silent corruption on decompression.
* Return the correct length by unzip_literal.
* Use wrappers to serialise threads on OSX and bypass use of unnamed semaphores
which aren't supported.

DECEMBER 2010, version 0.551 Con Kolivas
* Fix stdin failing due to getting sizes all wrong.
* Fix stdin compression values not being shown at end.
* Fix inappropriate failure when lzma doesn't compress block.

DECEMBER 2010, version 0.550 Con Kolivas
* Move the threading on compression to higher up in the code, allowing the next
stream to start using compression threads before the previous stream has
finished. This speeds up compression on files that take more than one pass to
compress.
* Limit the number of threads decompressing stream 0 to just 1 since it's always
followed by stream 1 chunks, and it may lead to failure to decompress due to
running out of memory by running too many threads.
* Default compression level and window size on lzma is set to 7 which is the
highest it goes. Scale the 9 lrzip levels into 7, thus making the default lzma
level 5 which uses a lot less memory and is substantially faster at the cost of
some compression.
* Rationalise the memory testing now that the default lzma settings use a lot
less ram by default, and make all systems use no more than 1/3 ram in one mmap.
This allows larger windows to be used by 32 bit at last without memory
allocation errors.
* Revert "Make threads spawn at regular intervals along chunk size thus speeding
up compression" as it actually slowed it down instead of speeding it up.
* Cope with compression/decompression threads failing by waiting till the
previous thread has finished its work, thus serialising the work and using less
ram, making success more likely.
* Fix some dodgy callocs which weren't really allocating enough ram.
* Destroy semaphores used in stream_in on closing the stream.
* Minor output improvements.

DECEMBER 2010, version 0.544 Con Kolivas
* Make multiple stream 0 entry decompression more robust by creating separate
thread groups for stream 0 and stream 1.
* uclibc fails to return valid values for memory size with sysconf so create
a workaround.
* 32 bits has memory allocation errors on large files so be ruthless with
limiting window sizes and use more sliding mmap.
* Split up compression streams according to proportion of hash search thus
evenly distributing work to threads based on raw data length rather than
rzip pre-processed data. This makes for more CPU usage on compression and
smoother write out on decompression with small speed ups.
* Remove unnecessary argument passing.
* Fix -U causing a floating point error with ultra small sized files.
* 32 bits still sometimes fails the lzma compression stage due to internal
memory allocation issues, so use bzip2 as a fallback on blocks that fail to
compress.
* Minor cleanups.

NOVEMBER 2010, version 0.543 Con Kolivas
* Fix for when there are multiple stream 0 entries per chunk, which would
cause a failure on decompression.
* Fix lzma windows being set far too small by mistake at all times.
* Decrease nice level of main process compared to back end threads as it tends
to be the rate limiting step.

NOVEMBER 2010, version 0.542 Con Kolivas
* Choose sane defaults for memory usage since linux ludicriously overcommits.
* Use sliding mmap for any compression windows greater than 2/3 ram.
* Consolidate and simplify testing of allocatable ram.
* Minor tweaks to output.
* Round up the size of the high buffer in sliding mmap to one page.
* Squeeze a little more out of 32 bit compression windows.
* Fix sliding mmap from not working on 2nd pass onwards.

NOVEMBER 2010, version 0.541 Con Kolivas
* Fix wrong number of passes reported.
* Re-fix the off-by-one that wasn't off-by-one.
* Limit lzma compression windows to 300MB as per reports of failures with larger
windows.

NOVEMBER 2010, version 0.540 Con Kolivas
* Massive rewrite of backend decompression phse, implementing multithreading.
This is done by taking each stream of data on read in into separate buffers for
up to as many threads as CPUs. As each thread's data becomes available, feed it
into runzip once it is requests more of the stream. Provided there are enough
chunks in the originally compressed data, this provides a massive speedup
potentially proportional to the number of CPUs. The slower the backend
compression, the better the speed up (i.e. zpaq is the best sped up).
* Fix the output of zpaq compress and decompress from trampling on itself and
racing and consuming a lot of CPU time printing to the console.
* When limiting cwindow to 6 on 32 bits, ensure that control.window is also set.
* When testing for the maximum size of testmalloc, the multiple used was out by
one, so increase it.
* Minor output tweaks.
* Build warning fixes.
* Updated benchmarks.

NOVEMBER 2010, version 0.530 Con Kolivas
* Massive rewrite of backend compression phase. Now the stream is split up
into as many chunks as there are CPUs, of at least 10MB in size, that are
still mallocable. Once the stream has reached a chunk of this size, its buffer
is handed to a new backend compression thread which works while the rzip stream
continues processing. This has the effect of parallelising workloads almost
linearly up to the number of CPUs on the slower compression backends. ZPAQ,
in particular, is effectively 4x faster on quad core now. Decompression is
unchanged.
* Added the -p option to allow the number of processors to be specified to
override the detected number.
* Changed the default level back to 7 as 9 wasn't offering significanly more
compression but was adding time.
* Increased the size of all the buffers to other backends now as well, since
each block adds overhead with its header.
* Numerous alterations to screen output to cope with new threaded compression
phase.
* Deprecated the -P option since not setting the file permissions only
generates a warning now, not a failure.
* Updated docs and benchmarks.

NOVEMBER 2010, version 0.520 Con Kolivas
* Distros don't like 3 point version numbering so just repackaged as 0.520.

NOVEMBER 2010, version 0.5.2 Con Kolivas
* Fixed the Darwin build, again.
* Fixed cases of extreme ram usage on 32 bit failing by limiting zpaq to 600MB
windows as well.
* Check page size if we can instead of assuming it's always 4k.
* Improve the progress output.
* Change failure to chmod and failure to set nice level to warnings only.
* Standardise what's a stderr message and what's output.

NOVEMBER 2010, version 0.5.1 Con Kolivas
* Fix Darwin build - Darwin doesn't support mremap so introduce a fake wrapper
for it.
* Fix the memopen routines, a wrongly implemented wrapper for Darwin equivalents
was also using the faked versions on all builds.
* Fix dodgy ordered includes.
* Clean up excessive use of #ifdefs
* Huge rewrite of buffer reading in rzip.c. We use a wrapper instead of
accessing the buffer directly, thus allowing us to have window sizes larger than
available ram. This is implemented through the use of a "sliding mmap"
implementation. Sliding mmap uses two mmapped buffers, one large one as
previously, and one smaller one. When an attempt is made to read beyond the end
of the large buffer, the small buffer is remapped to the file area that's being
accessed, while the larger one is remapped as the search progresses along the
file. While this implementation is potentially much slower than direct mmapping,
it allows us to implement unlimited sized compression windows.
* Implement the -U option with unlimited sized compression windows.
* Rework the selection of compression windows. Instead of trying to guess how
much ram the machine might be able to access, we try to safely buffer as much
ram as we can, and then use that to determine the file buffer size. Do not
choose an arbitrary upper window limit unless -w is specified.
* Rework the -M option to try to buffer the entire file, reducing the buffer
size until we succeed.
* Align buffer sizes to page size.
* Clean up lots of unneeded variables.
* Fix lots of minor logic issues to do with window sizes accepted/passed to rzip
and the compression backends.
* More error handling.
* Change -L to affect rzip compression level directly as well as backend
compression level and use 9 by default now.
* Fix file size reporting on compressed files generated from stdin.
* More cleanups of information output and more information.
* Add chunk percentage to progress update.
* Reinstated the 2GB buffer limit on 32 bit machines during compression, though
the -U mode can work around it now.
* Code micro-optimisations.
* Use 3 point release numbering in case one minor version has many subversions.
* Numerous minor cleanups and tidying.
* Updated docs, manpages, and benchmarks.

NOVEMBER 2010, version 0.5 Con Kolivas
* Changed offset encoding in rzip stage to use variable byte width offsets
instead of 64 bits wide. Makes for better compression and slightly faster.
* Write the byte width into the file before each block.
* Shrunk match lengths to maximum of 16 bits again as per original rzip as the
larger offsets did not achieve greater compression and made final size larger.
* New file format not backwards compatible due to variable byte widths.
* Rewrote memory initialisation to have a pre-allocation stage to try and
find the maximum memory usable and defragment ram.
* Use reduced window size if allocating memory fails at higher size.
* Change use of malloc to mmap to make it possible to address up to 44 bit
sized offsets even on 32 bit machines on decompression. Still unable to use
greater than 2GB windows on 32 bit machines and unsure if this is fixable.
* Reworked the STDIN code to use an anonymous mmap and read in stdin into this
to make it possible to compress from STDIN without the need for temporary
files. As the file size is not known in advance, memory allocation is set to
large and byte width to equivalent size.
* Reallocation of ram where possible to minimise risk of running out of memory
in the middle of a compression phase, and flushing to disk to empty dirty ram
for the same reason.
* More robust fatal warnings.
* Numerous cleanups and tidying of code and addition of comments.
* Updated documentation to reflect changes.

OCTOBER 2010, version 0.47, Con Kolivas
* Fix the symlinking problem when DESTDIR is in use reported by a billion
people.

MAY 2010, version 0.46, Con Kolivas, Ed Avis.
* Suppress final [OK] message with -q flag EA
* Handle mkstemp() errors correctly EA
* Add lrzuntar manpage
* Update manpages

APRIL 2010, version 0.45, Con Kolivas, Jon Tibble, George Makrydakis
* Fixes the nasm program test (AC_CHECK_PROG doesn't overwrite a
variable that is already set so do it manually) JT
* Fix compiler flags as not all compilers accept -Wall -W (cc on
Solaris/OpenSolaris) JT
* Fix lrztar to not try to compress files already with the .lrz extension GM
* Fix lrztar to decompress files where the pathname is ../* GM
* Add lrzuntar symlink to call lrztar -d


MAR 2010, version 0.45, Con Kolivas, Jari Aalto
* Fixed reported window size
* Fixed 32bit windows being attempted to be larger than contiguous amounts
by taking into account VM kernel/userspace split of 896MB.
* Minor code cleanups
* Added lrztar and lrunzip docs
* Fix minor typos
* Added distclean and maintainer-clean make targets


DEC 2009, version 0.44, Con Kolivas, George Makrydakis
* Added lrztar wrapper to manage whole directories.
* Added -i option to provide information about a compressed file.
* Fixed "nan" showing as Compression speed on very small files.
* Fixed build for old bz library.
* Avoid overwriting output file if input doesn't exist.
* Implement signal handler to delete temporary files.


DEC 2009, version 0.43, Con Kolivas, Jukka Laurila
* Darwin support thanks to Jukka Laurila.
* Finally added stdin/stdout support due to popular demand. This is done
by basically using temporary files so is a low performance way of using
lrzip.
* Added test function. This just uses a temporary file during decompression.
* Config files should now accept zpaq options.
* Minor code style cleanups.
* Updated benchmarks in docs.
* Add a warning when attempting to decompress a file from a newer lrzip
version.


NOV 2009, version 0.42, Con Kolivas
* Changed progress update to show which of 2 chunks are being compressed
in zpaq.
* Fixed progress update in ZPAQ to not update with each byte which was
wasting heaps of CPU time.


NOV 2009, version 0.41, Con Kolivas
* Added zpaq compression backend for extremely good but extremely slow
compression (incompatible with previous versions if used).
* Limited chunk size passed to LZMA to 4GB to avoid library overflows.
* Minor changes to the formatting output
* Changed lower limit of -T threshhold to 0 to allow disabling it.
* Added lzo_compresses check into zpaq and bzip2 as well since they're
slow.


NOV 2009, version 0.40, Con Kolivas
* Massive core code rewrite.
* All code moved to be 64bit based for compression block addressing and length
allowing compression windows to be limited by ram only.
* 64bit userspace should now have no restriction on compression window size,
32bit is still limited to 2GB windows due to userspace limitations.
* New file format using the new addressing and data types, incompatible with
versions prior to 0.40.
* Support for reading and decompressing older formats.
* Minor speedups in read/write routines.
* Countless minor code fixes throughout.
* Code style cleanups and consistency changes in core code.
* Configure script improvements.


NOV 2009, version 0.31, Con Kolivas
* Updated to be in sync with lzma SDK 9.07beta.
* Cleanups and fixes of the configure scripts to use the correct package version
name.
* Massive fixes to the memory management code fixing lots of 32bit overflow
errors. The window size limit is now 2GB on both 32bit and 64bit. While it
appears to be smaller than the old windows, only 900MB was being used on .30
even though it claimed to use more. This can cause huge improvements in the
compression of very large files.
* The offset when mmap()ing was not being set to a multiple of page size so
it would fail if the window size was not a multiple of it.
* Flushing of data to disk between compression windows was implemented to
minimise disk thrashing of read vs write.


NOV 2009, version 0.30, Con Kolivas
* Numerous bugfixes to try and make the most of 64bit environments with huge
memory and to barf less on 32bit environments.
* Executable stacks were fixed.
* Probably other weird and wonderful bugs have been introduced.
* -P option to not set permissions on output files allowing you to write to
braindead filesystems (eg fat32).


JAN 2009, version 0.24, Peter Hyman, pete@peterhyman.com
Happy New Year!
* Upgrade LZMA SDK to 4.63. Use new C Wrapper. Invalidates
  LZMA archives created earlier due to new Magic property
  bytes.
* New LZMA logic will automatically determine allow LZMA
  code to determine optimal lc, lp, pb, fb, and dictionary
  size settings. stream.c will only pass level and thread
  information. Compress function will return encoded 5 byte
  data with compression settings. This will be stored in lrz
  file header.
* add error messages during LZMA compression. There are some
  edge cases where LZMA cannot allocate memory. These errors
  are reported and the user will be advised to use a lower
  compression window setting.
* type changes in rzip_fd function for correctness.
* remove function *Realloc() since it was never used. Cleaned
  in rzip.h and util.c.
* apply munmap prior to closing and compressing stream in
  function rzip_chunk in rzip.c.
* add realloc function in close_stream_out in stream.c
  to reclaim some ram and try and allieviate out of memory
  conditions in LZMA compression.
* remove file acconfig.h and include DEFINE in configure.in.
* add lrzip.conf capability.
* add timer for compression including elapsed time and eta.
* add compression and decompression MB/s calculation.
* Updated WHATS-NEW, TODO and created BUGS file.
* Updated lrzip.1 manpage and created lrzip.conf.5 manpage.
* Added lrzip.conf.example file in doc directory.

MAR 2008, Con Kolivas, kernel@kolivas.org
* Numerous changes all over to place restrictions on window
size to work with 32 bit limitations.
* Various bugfixes with respect to detecting buffer sizes and
likelihood of compressibility.
* Fixed the inappropriate straight copying uncompressed data for
files larger than 4GB.
* Re-initiated the 10MB window limits for non-lzma compression.
I was unable to reproduce any file size savings.
* Allow compression windows larger than ramsize if people really
really want them.
* Decrease thresholds for the test function to a minimum of 5%
compressibility since the hanging in lzma compression bug has been
fixed.

JAN 2008, version 0.22, Peter Hyman, pete@peterhyman.com
* version update
lzma/LZMALib.cpp
  Thanks to Lasse Collin for debugging the problem LZMA
  had with hanging on uncompressable files.
  Update for control parameters to both compress and
  decompress functions.
Makefile.in
* use of @top_srcdir@ (Lasse Collin). Also moved away
  more cruft.
main.c stream.c.rzip.h LZMALib.cpp lzmalib.h
* addition of three new control structure members.
  control.lc -- literal context bits
  control.lp -- literal post state bits
  control.pb -- post state bits
  These are needed to ensure decompression will work.
  These will now be stored along with control.compression_level
  in the lrz file beginning at offset 0x16 for three bytes.
  These will be passed to the functions lzma_compresses and
  lzma_uncompress. Currently, only compression level is
  needed or used, but the others are stored for possible future
  use.
  See magic file for more information.
stream.c
* Change to lzo_compresses function that will reject a chunk
  without testing it if the size of the chunk is greater
  than the compression window * threshold. This is to avoid
  a low probability that lzma would still be passed a chunk
  that contains uncompressible data or barely compressible
  data. If after rzip hashing the chunk size is still close
  to the window size, there is hardly anything worth
  compressing. While there is no reason lzma cannot get the
  chunk, this will save a lot of time.
magic.headers.txt
* updated file to show new layout that includes lzma
  parameters.
README-NOT-BACKWARD-COMPATIBLE
* added warning about using lrzip-0.22 with earlier versions.
WHATS-NEW
* highlight of new features.

DEC 2007, version 0.21. Peter Hyman, pete@peterhyman.com
* version update.
* Modified to use Assembler routines from lzma SDK for CRC
  computation when hashing streams in rzip.c and runzip.c.
  Added files 7zCrcT8.c and 7zCrcT8u.s to lzma tree.
  Cleaned up source tree. Moved unused files out of the way.
  Moved non-core docs to doc directory
configure.in
* correct AC_INIT to set program variables.
* modified to add check for nasm assembler.
* modified syntax of test for errno in error.h to use
  echo $ECHO_N/$ECHO_C instead of $ac_n/$ac_c which
  was incorrect.
Makefile.in, lzma/Makefile
* modified to add compile instructions for 7zCrcT8.c
  and 7zCrcT8U.s and Assembler. Cleaned up to remove
  targets that don't exist or sources that don't
  exist.
  Modified to properly set directories. Added doc install.
  Add link command to symlink lrunzip to lrzip.
*main.c
  Add CrcGenerateTable() function to init CRC tables.
  This is needed for all crc routines including those
  in MatchFinderMT.
rzip.c and runzip.c
* Updated source to change call to crc32_buffer to call
  CrcUpdate in the assembler code. Changed parameter order
  to conform.
stream.c
* Removed 10MB limit on streams for bzip, gzip, and lzo.
  This, to improve effeciency of long range analysis. For
  some files, this could improve results.
Current-Benchmarks.txt
* Added file to keep benchmarks current to version.
  (probably need to update README too).
README.Assembler
* Explain how to remove default compile of Assembler
  modules.
config.sub config.guess
* added files for system detection.

DEC 2007, version 0.20. Peter Hyman, pete@peterhyman.com

* Updated to LZMA SDK 4.57.
* Updated to p7zip POSIX version. (www.p7zip.org)
* Added multi-threading support (up to 2x speed with LZMA).
* Edited LZMADecompress.cpp for backward compatibility
  with decompress function. Needed SetPropertiesRaw function.
* Repopulated source tree for distribution.
* Updated Makefile.in to reflect new source files.
  Updated to include command to link lrunzip to lrzip because
  lrzip will test if lrunzip was used on command line.
* Updated Makefile.in for new compile time and linking options.
* Updated LZMALibs.cpp to include new property members for
  LZMAEncoders as well as changed default dictionaries to
  level+16. This would make the default compression level
  of 7 translate to a dictionary number of 23.
* Added output to show Nice Level when verbose mode set
  Initial add of support for zlib which seems to give quite
  excellent performance.
* configure.in added AC_CHECK for libz and libm.
  Added AC_PROG_LN_S for Makefile symlink section.
* lrzip.1 updated man page for -g option
* main.c added option test for gzip
  Added sysconf(_SC_NPROCESSORS_CONF) for CPU detection
  for threading.
  Updated verbose output to show whether or not
  Threading will be used.
  Added Timer for each file compressed.
* rzip.h added flags for GZIP compression.
  Added control member for threads. Arg passed to
  lzma_conpress.
* stream.c update to accomodate gzip compress and decompress
  functions. Cleaned up file by rearranging functions into
  groups.
  Removed include of lzmalib.h since it was causing a
  compile time warning with zlib.h. Prototyped functions
  manually.
  Cleanup output from lzo_compresses function so that
  unnecessary linefeeds are eliminated.
  lzma_compress function call now uses threads as argument.
* Added README.benchmarks file to explain a method of
  comparing results between different methods.
* LZMALib.cpp, lzmalib.h. Adjust function lzma_compress
  prototype and function to include new argument threads.
  This parameter is now placed in properties.
* lzma/Makefile. Updated to reflect new API library.
  Updated to include Threading option.

DEC 2007, version 0.19. Con Kolivas.
* Added nice support, defaulting to nice 19.

DEC 2007, version 0.19. Peter Hyman, pete@peterhyman.com

* Major goal was to stop LZMA from hanging on some files.
  Accomplished this with a threhold setting that is used by
  the lzo_compresses function to better analyze chunk data.
  Threshold makes it less likely that uncompressible data
  will be passed to the LZMA compressor.

main.c
* Added Threshold option 1-10 to control LZMA compression attempt.
  Default value=2. This means that anything over 10% compression
  as reported by lzo_compresses will return a true value to
  the LZMA compression function.
* Added verbosity option and more verbosity option (-v[v]).
* Added -O option to specify output directory.
* Updated compress_file and decompress_file functions to handle.
  output directories and better handle multi files and filename
  extensions. Optimized some string handling routines.
  Improved flexibility in determining location of output files
  when using -O. Added fflush(stdout) to improve printf reliability.
* decompress_file will accept any filename and will automatically
  append .lrz if not present. Won't automatically fail.
* Added logic to protect against conflicting options such as
  -q and -v, -o and -O.
* Added printout to screen of options selected. Will display
  only when -v or -vv used.
* Adjusted several printf statements to avoid compiler
  warnings (use %ll for long long int types).

runzip.c
* Added decompression progress indicator.
  Will show percent decompressed along with bytes decompressed
  and total to be decompressed. Will show if -q option NOT used.

rzip.h
* Version incremented to 0.19.
* Added flag DEFINESs for verbosity and more verbosity.
* Updated control struct to include output directory and
  threshold value. Removed verbosity member.

rzip.c
* Minor changes to handle display when verbosity set. Changed
  number format in some printf statements to properly handle
  unsigned data.

stream.c
* major overhaul of lzo_compresses function to use a threshold
  value when testing a data chunk to see if it is suitable for
  LZMA compression. Optimized test loop to improve performance
  and reduce number of passes. Improved output reporting depending
  on verbosity setting.
* Added print controls for verbosity option.
* Corrected if statements that tested for error condition of
  some lzo functions that only return a true value regardless.

lrzip.1
* updated man page to show new options and explain -T threshold.

README
* updated README to explain -T threshold option.

README.lzo_compresses.test.txt
* Added this file to help explain the theory behind the rewrite
  of the lzo_compresses function and how to use the -T option.

TODO
* wish list and future enhancements.

ChangeLog
* added file.
