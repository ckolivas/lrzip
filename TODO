MAYBE TODO for lrzip program

Upgrade to newer version of zpaq supporting 3 compression levels without
relying on open_memstream so it works without temporary files on apple.

Get MD5 working on apple.

Make sure STDIO works properly on large files on apple.

Make a liblrzip library.

Other posix/windows builds?? Need help there...

Add log file option so that output could be
saved for review.

Add test function that would only run lzo_compresses
for a current file without doing any writes.

Consider ncurses version or even GUI one.

Consider using LZMA Filters for processor-optimised
coding to increase compression.
