README.Assembler

Update November 2019

Assembler is enabled by
./configure --enable-asm
and disabled by
./configure --disable-asm
not
ASM=no ./configure

New files replace 32 and 64 bit assembler code.
fixes to lzma/C/Makefile.am permit libtool linking.

Original text follows.

Notes about CRC Assembly Language Coding.

lrzip-0.21 makes use of an x86 assembly language file
that optimizes CRC computation used in lrzip. It includes
a wrapper C file, 7zCrcT8.c and the assembler code,
7zCrcT8U.s.

configure should detect your host system properly
and adjust the Makefile accordingly. If you don't
have the nasm assembler or have a ppc or other non-
x86 system, the standard C CRC routines will be
compiled and linked in.

If for any reason configure does not properly
detect your system type, or you do not want assembler
modules to be compiled, you can run

ASM=no ./configure

which will automatically not include the asm module or
change the line

ASM_OBJ=7zCrcT8.o 7zCrcT8U.o
to
ASM_OBJ=7zCrc.o

in Makefile. This will change the dependency tree.

To force assembly module compilation and linking (if
configure does not detect your system type properly),
type

ASM=yes ./configure

or change the Makefile to include the ASM_OBJ files
as described above.


Type `make clean' and then re-run make.
